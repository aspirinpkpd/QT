  abstract        = {The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a guidance entitled "E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The guidance provides recommendations to sponsors concerning clinical studies to assess the potential of a new drug to cause cardiac arrhythmias, focusing on the assessment of changes in the QT/QTc interval on the electrocardiogram as a predictor of risk. The guidance is intended to encourage the assessment of drug effects on the QT/QTc interval as a standard part of drug development and to encourage the early discussion of this assessment with FDA.},

  abstract = "This White Paper, written collaboratively by members of the
              Cardiac Safety Research Consortium from academia, industry, and
              regulatory agencies, discusses different methods to characterize
              the QT effects for drugs that have a substantial direct or
              indirect effect on heart rate. Descriptions and applications are
              provided for individualized QT-R-R correction, Holter bin,
              dynamic QT beat-to-beat, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
              modeling, and QT assessment at constant heart rate. Most of these
              techniques are optimally performed using continuous
              electrocardiogram data obtained in clinical studies designed to
              characterize a drug's effect on the QT interval. An important
              study design element is the collection of drug-free data over a
              range of heart rates seen on treatment. The range of heart rates
              is increased at baseline by using ambulatory electrocardiogram
              recordings in addition to those collected under semisupine,
              resting conditions. Discussions in this study summarize areas of
              emerging consensus and other areas in which consensus remains
              elusive and provide suggestions for additional research to
              further increase our knowledge and understanding of this topic.",
